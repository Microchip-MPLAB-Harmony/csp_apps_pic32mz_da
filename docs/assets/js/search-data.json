EU Consumers � Applicable Terms. WHERE LICENSEE IS A CONSUMER LOCATED IN EUROPE, THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS APPLY INSTEAD OF SECTIONS 9 AND 10 BELOW: Microchip and its licensors will not be liable (a) for any loss suffered by Licensee in connection with the Software where such loss was not reasonably foreseeable when the Software was first downloaded by Licensee, even if such loss was the result of negligence or the failure of Microchip and its licensors to comply with this Agreement; or (b) irrespective of the basis of claim, for any loss of revenue, profit or other business or economic loss suffered. Some Software is made available to Licensee free of charge, and Licensee may at any time download further copies without charge to replace the Software initially downloaded and others may require a fee to be downloaded, or to download any further copies. In all circumstances, to the extent liability may lawfully be limited or excluded, the cumulative liability of Microchip and its licensors will not exceed USD$1,000 (or equivalent sum in the currency of the country in which Licensee resides). However, none of the foregoing limits or excludes any liability for death or personal injury arising from negligence, or for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or any other cause that by law cannot be excluded and limited. 10. Warranty Disclaimers. EXCEPT FOR CONSUMERS TO WHOM SECTION 8 APPLIES, THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS. MICROCHIP MAKES NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STAUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT AND ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM USAGE OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING. MICROCHIP AND ITS LICENSORS HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO CORRECT ANY DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, IF PROVIDED, WILL NOT EXPAND THESE WARRANTIES. IF CUSTOMER IS A CONSUMER, THE ABOVE WILL NOT ACT TO EXCLUDE YOUR STATUTORY RIGHTS. 11. Limited Liability. EXCEPT FOR CONSUMERS TO WHOM SECTION 8 APPLIES, IN NO EVENT WILL MICROCHIP BE LIABLE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, INDEMNITY, CONTRIBUTION OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS, DAMAGE, COST OR EXPENSE OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, HOWEVER CAUSED, OR ANY LOSS OF PRODUCTION, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF USE OR LOSS OF DATA, OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF MICROCHIP HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. MICROCHIP'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED USD$1,000. 12. General. (a) This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona and the United States, without regard to conflicts of law provisions. The parties hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts in Maricopa County, Arizona for any dispute relating to this Agreement. WHERE LICENSEE IS A CONSUMER LOCATED IN EUROPE, this Agreement is subject to the laws of the country in which the Software is downloaded, and, to the extent so mandated by such laws, subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of that country. The parties expressly disclaim the applicability of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods in connection with this Agreement. (b) Unless the parties have a mutually executed agreement relating to the licensing of this Software by Microchip to Licensee (\"Signed Agreement\"), this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Software, and supersedes and replaces prior or contemporaneous written or verbal agreements or communications between the parties regarding the Software, including any purchase orders. If the parties have a Signed Agreement, this Agreement does not supersede or replace that Signed Agreement. This Agreement will not be modified except by a written agreement signed by an authorized representative of Microchip. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement constitutes a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions of this Agreement, and no waiver will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. (c) Licensee agrees to comply with all import and export laws and restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce or other United States or foreign agency or authority. (d) This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns. Licensee may not assign this Agreement in whole or in part, whether by law or otherwise, without Microchip's prior written consent. Any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, reorganization, transfer of all or substantially all assets or other change in control or majority ownership (\"Change of Control\") is considered an assignment for the purpose of this Section. Any attempt to assign this Agreement without such consent will be null and void. However, Microchip may assign this Agreement to an affiliate, or to another entity in the event of a Change of Control. (e) Licensee acknowledges its breach of any confidentiality or proprietary rights provision of this Agreement would cause Microchip irreparable damage, for which the award of damages would not be an adequate remedy. Licensee, therefore, agrees if Microchip alleges that Licensee has breached or violated any such provisions then Microchip may seek equitable relief, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity. (f) Authorized representatives of Microchip shall have the right to reasonably inspect Licensee's premises and to audit Licensee's records and inventory of Licensee Products, whether located on Licensee's premises or elsewhere at any time, announced or unannounced, and in its sole and absolute discretion, in order to ensure Licensee's adherence to the terms of this Agreement. (g) Consistent with 48 C.F.R. �12.212 or 48 C.F.R. �227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Software is being licensed to U.S. Government end users (i) only as Commercial Items, and (ii) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable Microchip licenses. To the extent the Software (or a portion thereof) qualifies as �technical data' as such term is defined in 48 C.F.R. �252.227-7015(a)(5), then its use, duplication, or disclosure by the U.S. Government is subject to the restrictions set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (e) of the Rights in Technical Data clause at 48 C.F.R. �252.227-7015.

    "content": "This example application shows how to use the cache maintenance APIs to avoid issues related to cache coherency when the data cache is enabled. The application uses the USART and the DMA PLIBs to demonstrate the cache maintenance APIs provided by the Cache peripheral library. It registers a callback with the DMA transmit and receive channels. The application first transmits a message using the DMA transmit channel and then schedules a read of ten characters using the DMA receive channel. Once the DMA read is complete, it reads the received data and echoes the same on the terminal using the DMA transmit channel. The application calls the DCACHE_CLEAN_BY_ADDR API on the write buffer before transmitting it. Calling this API copies the data from the cache memory to the main memory, thereby ensuring that the DMA peripheral uses the updated values in the write buffer. The application calls the DCACHE_INVALIDATE_BY_ADDR API on the read buffer after reception of data is complete by the DMA receive channel. Calling this API invalidates the cache region corresponding to the read buffer, thereby ensuring that the CPU reads the updated values in the read buffer from the main memory and into the cache. The cache maintenance operations are always performed on a cache line (1 cache line = 32 bytes), the read and write buffers must be aligned to a 32 byte boundary and must be a multiple of 32 bytes. For the same reason, the number of received and echoed back bytes is 10, the size of the receive and echo buffers is 32 bytes. ",
