# CORETIMER periodic interrupt

This example application shows how to use the CoreTimer to generate periodic interrupts.

## Description

This example application configures the CoreTimer Peripheral Library to generate periodic interrupts. The application registers a periodic timeout callback. It toggles an LED every time the callback is triggered.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_pic32mz_da) and click

![clone](../../../docs/images/clone.png)

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/coretimer/coretimer_periodic_timeout/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.
