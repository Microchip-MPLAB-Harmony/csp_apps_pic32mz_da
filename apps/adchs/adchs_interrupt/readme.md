# ADCHS Interrupt

This example application shows how to sample an analog input using the ADCHS peripheral and displays the converted samples on a serial terminal.

## Description

In this application, an analog input is converted by a hardware trigger generated by the TMR peripheral. Result is read in the conversion complete interrupt handler. Converted digital value is displayed on the serial terminal.
