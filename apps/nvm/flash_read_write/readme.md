# NVM flash read write

This example application demonstrates how to use the NVM to erase and program the internal Flash memory.

## Description

This example uses the NVM peripheral library to erase a page and write an array of values to the internal Flash memory. It verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written.

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application project using its respective IDE
2. LED indicates the success or failure:
    - LED is turned ON when the value read from the Flash matched with the written value

Following table provides the LED name:

| Board | LED name |
| ----- | -------- |
| [PIC32MZ Embedded Graphics with Stacked DRAM (DA) Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320010) | LED1 |
