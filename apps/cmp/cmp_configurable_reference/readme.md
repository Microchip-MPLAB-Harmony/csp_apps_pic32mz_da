# CMP configurable reference

This example application shows how to use the CMP Peripheral library to compare voltage level on the negative input with the internal configurable reference voltage.

## Description

The peripheral named comparator voltage reference (CVR) can be used by the CMP peripheral. It generates a voltage that can be connected internally to the +ve input of the any of the comparators in the device. This allows to set flexible compare voltages.

### Setting up [PIC32MZ Embedded Graphics with Stacked DRAM (DA) Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320010)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Connect the USB to UART port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Pin 27 (C2INB) on J15 is the negative input. Connect it to a voltage below the reference voltage (~2V from CVR peripheral) to trigger interrupt
